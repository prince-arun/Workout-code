      //2. Promise.allSettled
      //Promise.allSettled()
      //receives array of promises. here it wait to settle all, whether it resolved or rejected.
      //It outputs the value of resolved,and gives error's of which are rejected, based on given logic.

      //3. Promise.race()
      //here it waits only for the first promise to settle. then outputs results, whether resolved or rejected.

      //4. Promise.any()
      //here it waits for the the first fulfilled promise and gives it's output.
