      // weakmap.set(ke, value),    weakmap.get(key),     weakmap.has(key),     weakmap.delete(key)

      //----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      // As works in Set, the weakset also only takes one value, does not allows the duplicated multiple values.
